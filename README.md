# Veterinary E-commerce & Management System

Professional project developed for a local veterinary clinic in Aguascalientes.

## Project Goal
Develop a comprehensive web application to manage real-time inventory, Point of Sale (POS) for physical store sales, and an online store with automated fiscal invoicing.

## Tech Stack & Justification
*We selected these tools to ensure a professional, secure, and cost-effective solution:*

- **React.js:** For a high-performance, responsive UI that handles complex state management (like real-time inventory updates).
- **Firebase:** To provide real-time data sync and secure cloud storage with $0 initial maintenance costs.
- **Mercado Pago API:** To ensure secure transactions and seamless integration with existing **Point Smart** hardware.
- **Mexican e-invoicing API:** (Facturama/Factura.com) To automate tax compliance and professional billing for clients.

## Business Logic & Features
* **Omnichannel Inventory:** Real-time synchronization between the physical warehouse and the online store.
* **Smart Delivery Logistics:** * **Same-Day Delivery:** Available for orders placed between **5:00 AM and 3:00 PM** (Priority fee applies).
    * **Standard Delivery:** Orders after 3:00 PM are scheduled for the next business day.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Designed to run on free-tier cloud services, eliminating legacy software license fees.
